			<p><u>The Ulu</u><br><br><b>ᐅᓗ</b> is a type of knife used primarily by women in Inuit culture. These blades could be constructed from a variety of materials ranging from whalebone, pine root, and copper.<br>
			Having seen an ulu being used on a freshly caught young ring seal, I can say with confidence that its razor sharp edge splits the fat from the skin quicker than the eye can catch.<br>
			To see an Inuit woman practiced in the art of preparing skin is a reminder of past skills and how they carried within them an almost medatative aspect of repitition and practiced rythms.<br>
			Not only does the practice of hide preperation produce a versitile and beautiful piece of workable material, but it emphasizes the importance of tradition be using the iconic ulu to make it possible.<br><br>
			If you get the chance to use this tool, I suggest cutting away from you all things considered.</p>
