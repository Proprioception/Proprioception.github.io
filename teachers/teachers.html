					<td><p><u>The Ulu</u><br><br><b>ᐅᓗ</b> is a type of knife used historically by women in Inuit culture. These blades could be constructed from a variety of materials ranging from whalebone, pine root, and copper.
			Having seen an ulu being used on a freshly caught young ring seal, I can say with confidence that its razor sharp edge splits the fat from the skin quicker than the eye can catch.
			To see an Inuit woman practiced in the art of preparing skin is a reminder of past skills and how they carried within them an almost medatative aspect of repitition and practiced rythms.
			Not only does the practice of hide preperation produce a versitile and beautiful piece of workable material, but it emphasizes the importance of tradition be using the iconic ulu to make it possible.<br><br>
			If you get the chance to use this tool, I suggest cutting away from you all things considered.</p></td>
